## Featured Projects

### 1. **Data Detective: Midterm Practical**
A Databricks notebook adventure where I wrangled, cleaned, and analyzed complex datasets to uncover insights under exam pressure. Think of it as CSI but with Spark.

### 2. **Crunch Time: Final Exam Analytics**
Final assessment where I showcased end-to-end problem solving with big data — from ingestion to analysis to visualization — all under the ticking clock.

### 3. **Carbon Neutrality Navigator**  
An exploration of Canada’s federal 2050 carbon neutrality goal, comparing **provincial targets vs. actual emission trends**. Identified gaps, sectoral challenges (like BC’s forestry & LNG), and policy levers for alignment.

### 4. **FlavourFriend 🍜**  
An AI kitchen sidekick — fusing cuisines with TF-IDF similarity and reconstructing recipes with T5 transformers. Current features:  
- **Cuisine fusion** (mix Italian + Indian, without weird combos like paneer tiramisu).  
- **Lost recipe reconstruction** from partial titles or handwritten notes.  
More features cooking soon…

### 5. **GENESIS: Freight & Mobility Platform**  
Led data/AI tasks in a multi-country pilot (Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica). Built reproducible geospatial ETL pipelines (GTFS + OSM), simulated demand, and containerized APIs.  
Outcome: scalable infrastructure for routing + emissions tracking.

### 6. **College Administration App**  
A lightweight **Python GUI app** for academic record management:  
- Upload student files, auto-detect missing data.  
- Calculate GPA, flag eligibility for colleges.  
- Generate reports and restart workflow in a single click.  
Simple but handy for testing end-to-end app logic.
